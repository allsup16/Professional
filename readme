This folder is going to be for the use of documentation for resume purposes.

In this folder I will write a html/css page to have an online refrence to give to recruiters. This page will feature information about myself, the projects I have worked on since starting this page and refrences to my github in order to see and test these projects.

I will record a weekly log and break down how I spend my time. Right now my schedule is looking like a 2hr/2hr(morning/evening) split on monday/tuesday and thursday/friday with a 4hr spot on saturday. Monday/tuesday will spent on tutorials/courses online in the morning and practice in the evening thrusday/friday will be spent working on refresher material learned in college in the morning and projects in the evening. Saturday will spend one hour updating html with weekly report, another hour spent on updating the html page itself and the last two hours working on my resume and applying for jobs.

the goal of this overall structure is to land a starting position and working towards a career in computer science. I have alot of obsiticals in front of me. I had a 2.61 gpa in college. I have a three year gap in my work history,since spring 2022. No real refrences. Only I.T. experience on work history, from 2019. No recent projects that I have done and the job market for CS careers isn't amazing right now. I have alot to do.
