    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> 
        &emsp;Hello My name is Bryant Allsup. I am a Computer Science graduate who is looking to start a career. I realize this is not the optimal time to
        this, but I decided it was time to get back into it. I graduated in 2022 after which I took a nearly 3 year hiatus, to take care of my grandfather in his waning years.
        He past in may of 2023. This left me in a strange spot in my life over the next year and a half, but on December 28 2024 I decided to make an honest attempt to get into this field.
        Over the time since then I did a few smaller projects and realized what fields I like and think are incredibly interesting and decided, I want to focus on
        automation.
    </p>
    <p>    
        &emsp;I think having a hands off process that I can check in on every once and awhile without making it a monotonous task is incredibly satisfying.
        Over the past year one way that have made money is doing monotonous task, daily surveys, daily checkin on multiple apps and watching ads being the 
        primary ones I would use to get a little extra money. While I did get a few hundred dollars off of these I think would slip up on all of them from time to time.
        With looking for little ways to make money I have started learning about crypto(mainly the fact that I can make money.) and decide to make a little trader.
        Using a wrapper I found online I have made a rudimentary trader. In all honesty I have no clue if it works, I did a very limited job at trying to find out if
        it makes money using ChatGPT. Even so I still get the happiest when thinking about this compared to all other way that I have made money. I love 
        having a system in place that I can spend a week away from and comeback and something has happened. This made me look farther into automation mainly in the fields Machine
        learning and data sciences. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;I have three main projects that I have in mind when starting. I want to make an automated system to collect microsoft rewards. 
        This will teach me about online extensions and will be easier to know when it's working because the rewards are fixed. Next project will be
        a coinbase trader. As I mentioned before I did do one before, This time I don't want to use a wrapper and instead really learn how to read documentation
        provided and learn to use api's properly. I would also like to further this project by doing statistics that give a break down on my 
        buys and sells to show if I am making money from dips or I if I am only making money from the overall increase in value of bitcoin. Finally this 
        would be a way for me to refresh on my limited knowldege of AWS and expand on it. Overall this would help my knowldege of Python,AWS,REST API's
        and SQL. The final project I have planned so far is starting an automated Youtube channel. The idea behind this channel is to create an enviorment
        that uses reinforcement based ML model to live and grow in a relaxing ecosystem for users to enjoy. The reason I chose these jobs is I like making money
        and these are good projects that have real finacial payoff that I can show as a measure of success.
    </p>

        &emsp;I want this page to be a way for me to clearly share my work and experience. I want to have a history and timeline that will let recruites know
        that I can do the things that I am claiming I can do. Finally I think this is just good incentive for me. Having a everything gathered up in one place, or even just a 
        click away lets me know that I have made progress. Overall I know this is going to be difficult and alot of work is going to be needed to get 
        where I want to be, but this page is going to help. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the projects I have to present right now.
