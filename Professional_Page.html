        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> 
            Hello My name is Bryant Allsup. I am a Computer Science graduate who is looking to start a career. I realize this is not the optimal time to
            this, but I decided it was time to get back into it. I graduated in 2022 after which I took a nearly 3 year hiatus, to take care of my grandfather in his waning years.
            He past in may of 2023. This left me in a strange spot in my life over the next year and a half, but on December 28 2024 I decided to make an honest attempt to get into this field.
            Over the time since then I did a few smaller projects and realized what fields I like and think are incredibly interesting and decided, I want to focus on
            automation.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I think having a hands off process that I can check in on every once and awhile without making it a monotonous task is incredibly satisfying.
            Over the past year one way that have made money is doing monotonous task, daily surveys, daily checkin on multiple apps and watching ads being the 
            primary ones I would use to get a little extra money. While I did get a few hundred dollars off of these I think would slip up on all of them from time to time.
            With looking for little ways to make money I have started learning about crypto(mainly the fact that I can make money.) and decide to make a little trader.
            Using a wrapper I found online I have made a rudimentary trader. In all honesty I have no clue if it works, I did a very limited job at trying to find out if
            it makes money using ChatGPT. Even so I still get the happiest when thinking about this compared to all other way that I have made money. I love 
            having a system in place that I can spend a week away from and comeback and something has happened. This made me look farther into automation mainly in the fields Machine
            learning and data sciences.

            I have three main projects that I have in mind when starting. I want to make an automated system to collect microsoft rewards. 
            This will teach me about online extensions and will be easier to know when it's working because the rewards are fixed. Next project will be
            a coinbase trader. As I mentioned before I did do one before, This time I don't want to use a wrapper and instead really learn how to read documentation
            provided and learn to use api's properly. I would also like to further this project by doing statistics that give a break down on my 
            buys and sells to show if I am making money from dips or I if I am only making money from the overall increase in value of bitcoin. Finally this 
            would be a way for me to refresh on my limited knowldege of AWS and expand on it. Overall this would help my knowldege of Python,AWS,REST API's
            and SQL. The final project I have planned so far is starting an automated Youtube channel. The idea behind this channel is to create an enviorment
            that uses reinforcement based ML model to live and grow in a relaxing ecosystem for users to enjoy. The reason I chose these jobs is I like making money
            and these are good projects that have real finacial payoff that I can show as a measure of success.

            I want this page to be a way for me to clearly share my work and experience. I want to have a history and timeline that will let recruites know
            that I can do the things that I am claiming I can do. Finally I think this is just good incentive for me. Having a everything gathered up in one place, or even just a 
            click away lets me know that I have made progress. Overall I know this is going to be difficult and alot of work is going to be needed to get 
            where I want to be, but this page is going to help. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the projects I have to present right now.

        <h3>Weekly Update: December 28 2024</h3>
        <p>First day, Started by making a first draft of my about me seection, everything is on one page, thier is no CSS styling added. I started
            working on a weekly update to document what I have done this week and keep a journal. Finally I made a github repo for this to also learn
            how to use github.
        </p>
        <h3>Weekly Update: January 4 2025</h3>
        <p>This week was a slow week getting back from the holidays, starting on monday and tuesday it was mainly spent researching how to 
            find ways around the auto. From what I found scheduling and inputs are a huge flag for most ites to detect botting. I decided to make a sleep
            function in my Selenium project in order to help with the input part of the funtion and I will be making a skript that will randomly decide
            if "today" I will be running the searches. The inconsistency will help keep it hard to detect. I type roughly 30-40 words a minute so the 
            sleep timer will be randomized between these areas with a smaller chance to go down to the 20's if it lands on this. the scheduler will mainly
            run in the day with a small chance to run at night. Overall this week was more of a planning for the next step with the only implimintation being the sleep function
            On Thursday I spent alot of the day packing and Friday was traveling so these days were limited to reviewing some older concepts that I need to
            refresh on. Thursday I did two sums on leet code and friday I did removed duplicate from sorted array and combine two tables. This was a little
            bit of practice for arrays and sql.
