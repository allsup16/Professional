    <h3>Weekly Update: December 28 2024</h3>
    <p>&emsp;First day, Started by making a first draft of my about me seection, everything is on one page, thier is no CSS styling added. I started
        working on a weekly update to document what I have done this week and keep a journal. Finally I made a github repo for this to also learn
        how to use github.

    <h3>Weekly Update: January 4 2025</h3>
    <p>&emsp;This week was a slow week getting back from the holidays, starting on monday and tuesday it was mainly spent researching how to 
        find ways around the auto. From what I found scheduling and inputs are a huge flag for most ites to detect botting. I decided to make a sleep
        function in my Selenium project in order to help with the input part of the funtion and I will be making a skript that will randomly decide
        if "today" I will be running the searches. The inconsistency will help keep it hard to detect. I type roughly 30-40 words a minute so the 
        sleep timer will be randomized between these areas with a smaller chance to go down to the 20's if it lands on this. the scheduler will mainly
        run in the day with a small chance to run at night. Overall this week was more of a planning for the next step with the only implimintation being the sleep function
        On Thursday I spent alot of the day packing and Friday was traveling so these days were limited to reviewing some older concepts that I need to
        refresh on. Thursday I did two sums on leet code and friday I did removed duplicate from sorted array and combine two tables. This was a little
        bit of practice for arrays and sql. On saturady worked on website by adding a style sheet and seperating the html file into an about me and a weekly update page.
    </p>
    <h3>Weekly Update: January 11 2025</h3>
    <p>&emsp; This Week I worked entirely on my Selenium project. I added the funtionality to delete from sentences that have a mistake in them.
        Added a bit more error handling. learned more about async and await and deleted all my unneeded async/await statements. I also changed the system I was using, 
        Instead of trying to type full words and fix them later I decided to change the system to a char by char implementation in order to make it easier.
        This caused alot of bugs and led to things like writing full words instead of char at mistake locations mainly seen in the choose char funtion.
        I also decided to change the space functionality to just independently add spaces after the chars instead of trying to add them to words. Made it easier
        than trimming everything and trying to use it with the mistyped library which appears to also trim words when it gives it back to you as an array.
        It is almost done just need to add a few delays, work on clean up, add more error handling, work on documentation and connect the 
        JSON file that contains a list of sentences to use to the project. Overall I am expecting to have it done by next tuesday. The project after
        I decided I am going to switch from the coinbase trader to my brothers website. It is going to be a professional website that I am gonna create a github
        for and host there. I have seen a few youtube videos talking about doing this so I want to try.Overall it should hopefully take about 2 week and I 
        can have it done by the begining of febuary. Right now I want to try and have 3 completed projects by late febuary in time for the UTEP job fair.
        Also by late febuary I want to be able to start applying for freelance jobs. Focusing back on the next project Thursday I should get together with him and 
        figure out deliverables.
