    <h3>Weekly Update: December 28 2024</h3>
    <p>&emsp;First day, Started by making a first draft of my about me seection, everything is on one page, thier is no CSS styling added. I started
        working on a weekly update to document what I have done this week and keep a journal. Finally I made a github repo for this to also learn
        how to use github.

    <h3>Weekly Update: January 4 2025</h3>
    <p>&emsp;This week was a slow week getting back from the holidays, starting on monday and tuesday it was mainly spent researching how to 
        find ways around the auto. From what I found scheduling and inputs are a huge flag for most ites to detect botting. I decided to make a sleep
        function in my Selenium project in order to help with the input part of the funtion and I will be making a skript that will randomly decide
        if "today" I will be running the searches. The inconsistency will help keep it hard to detect. I type roughly 30-40 words a minute so the 
        sleep timer will be randomized between these areas with a smaller chance to go down to the 20's if it lands on this. the scheduler will mainly
        run in the day with a small chance to run at night. Overall this week was more of a planning for the next step with the only implimintation being the sleep function
        On Thursday I spent alot of the day packing and Friday was traveling so these days were limited to reviewing some older concepts that I need to
        refresh on. Thursday I did two sums on leet code and friday I did removed duplicate from sorted array and combine two tables. This was a little
        bit of practice for arrays and sql. On saturady worked on website by adding a style sheet and seperating the html file into an about me and a weekly update page.
